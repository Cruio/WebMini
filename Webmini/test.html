        <p>The game is called Tobi the Water Skater. It was created by Lars Nielsen
        , David Mortensen, Emilie Arendttorp, Anders Skipper, and Anders Kobber√∏
        for Createjam 2019 Spring edition. Several keywords were selected randomly,
        which would serve as the theme of the game. The overall theme for the gamejam
        was the 80's and synthwave. The keywords randomly drawn were: desperately
        seeking high speed skater. In an attempt to be unique, the team chose
    to interpret skater as meaning a water skeeter. The game was therefore nominated for
  most original take on the theme, and it has been confirmed that the game received
at least 3 votes for best game at the game jam, out of a possible 70 something votes.</p>
